So what we can do is:
1. Take a 4x4 array
2. Place 2 2s at 2 random boxes
3. Ask user to press W,S,A or D. 
   a. W will cause numbers to slide to the uppermost row
   b. S will cause numbers to slide to the lowermost row
   c. A will cause numbers to slide to the leftmost row
   d. D will cause numbers to slide to the rightmost row
4. Intially the table will look like this

    |0   0   0   0|
    |             |
    |0   0   0   0|
    |             |
    |0   0   0   2|
    |             |
    |0   0   2   0|

5. Then if we press 'W', it will look like this

    |0   0   2   2|
    |             |
    |0   0   0   0|
    |             |
    |0   0   2   0|
    |             |
    |0   0   0   0|
    
    A 2 will be generated at a location at random
